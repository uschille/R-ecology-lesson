source("setup.R")
```

We will use the code block and output below to demonstrate one of the new features
provided by The Carpentries Workbench: automated feedback about changes to the
rendered lesson content that would be made by a pull request.

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```
